              # CRITICAL RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)

              1. B-ROLL PROTECTION
              - B-roll segments are marked with `# ... #`.
              - No zoom-ins or jump cuts may occur within or overlap any B-roll segment.
              - Each zoom-in must be fully outside B-roll.
              - Jump cuts must also occur outside B-roll.
              - If no suitable space is available, return `{"zoom_moments": []}`.

              2. TIMING & DISTRIBUTION
              - Exactly one zoom-in per full minute of video.
              - Total duration = (final timestamp) - (first sentence start).
              - Convert to minutes and decide:
                - If fractional part > 0.5, round up; else round down.
                - Example: 120.13s ≈ 2.002m → 2 zoom-ins; 598.13s ≈ 9.96m → 10 zoom-ins.
              - Distribute zoom-ins evenly across non-B-roll segments.

              3. TRANSITION TIMING (JUMP CUTS)
              - Place jump cuts at natural sentence/idea ends.
              - Never immediately after a zoom-in
              - If a zoom-in ends exactly at a sentence end, skip the next sentence; place the jump cut ≥2 sentence later.

              4. TRANSCRIPT FORMAT
              - CAPITALIZED words = emphasis.
              - `[...s]` indicates pause duration.
              - Start/End times at sentence ends.
              - `# text #` = B-roll segments.

              5. ZOOM-IN PRIORITY (HIGHEST TO LOWEST)
              1. Emphasized (CAPS) words/phrases followed by silence.
              2. Important concepts starting with “but”, “and”, “so”, “if”.
              3. Emotional questions.
              4. Exclamations.
              5. Emphasized words not followed by silence.

              6. MANDATORY PROCEDURE
              - Pre-Analysis:
                - Identify B-roll segments.
                - Calculate required zoom-ins.
                - Confirm adequate non-B-roll intervals.
              - Identification:
                - Find candidate zoom-in points by priority.
                - Exclude any overlapping B-roll.
              - Selection & Spacing:
                - Ensure each zoom-in is properly spaced.
                - Evenly distribute if possible; else maximize evenness.
              - Transition Analysis:
                - Place jump cuts after natural breaks.
                - Avoid B-roll overlap.

              7. OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON)
              - Return:
                  { "zoom_moments": [ 
                          { "sentence_number": <int>,
                            "zoom_in_phrase": "<exact phrase>",
                            "reason": "<why chosen>",
                            "transition_sentence_number": <int>,
                            "transition_sentence_word": "<exact phrase>",
                            "transition_reason": "<why chosen>" } 
                            ] 
                  }

              - If no zoom-ins: `{"zoom_moments": []}`

              8. B-ROLL VERIFICATION
              - Identify all `# ... #` segments as protected.
              - Ensure no zoom-in or jump cut overlaps these zones.

              9. FINAL CHECK
              - Verify all spacing, durations, and no B-roll conflicts.
              - Confirm phrases, sentence numbers, transitions.
              - Ensure total zoom-ins match the calculated requirement.

# # ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULES - MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT EXCEPTION

# 1. B-ROLL PROTECTION RULE
# - ⚠️ CRITICAL: B-roll segments are STRICTLY PROTECTED ZONES
# - NO zoom-ins or jump cuts may occur within or overlap ANY b-roll segment
# - Before placing ANY zoom-in or jump cut, VERIFY:
#   * The zoom-in start point is outside b-roll
#   * The entire zoom-in duration is outside b-roll (minimum 3 seconds)
#   * The jump cut point is outside b-roll
#   * The space between zoom-in and jump cut (minimum 3 seconds) is outside b-roll
# - If ANY part would overlap with b-roll, the zoom-in MUST be relocated or removed
# -If there is no any AVAILABLE space for zoom-in, give  {"zoom_moments": []}


# 2. PRECISE TIMING AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
# - MANDATORY: EXACTLY ONE zoom-in per minute of video duration
#   * Calculate the total seconds by finding the difference between the final timestamp and the starting timestamp of the first sentence.
#   * Convert to minutes and round up if the fractional part is greater than 0.5; otherwise, round down for the required zoom-ins.
#   * Example: 120.13 seconds ≈  2.002 minutes = EXACTLY 2 zoom-ins
#   * Example: 108.13 seconds ≈  1.8 seconds = EXACTLY 2 zoom-ins
  
# - REQUIRED SPACING:
#   * MINIMUM 3-second duration for each zoom-in
#   * Distribute remaining zoom-ins evenly across available non-b-roll segments
  
# - VERIFICATION STEPS:
#   1. Identify all b-roll segments and mark as unavailable
#   2. If target number cannot be met, then maximize even distribution

# 3. TRANSITION TIMING PROTOCOL
# - Jump Cut Placement Rules:
#   * MUST occur at complete end of SENTENCE or IDEA
#   * NEVER place immediately after zoom-in
#   * MUST maintain 3-second minimum spacing from zoom-in
#   * If zoom-in ends with sentence:
#     - Skip next immediate sentence
#     - Place jump cut at natural break point 1+ sentences later
#     - Ensure 3-second minimum spacing rule is met
#   * VERIFY all spacing requirements before finalizing

# # TRANSCRIPT FORMAT UNDERSTANDING
# - **Capitalized words** indicate emphasis in the audio
# - **Pauses** are denoted by brackets, e.g., `[...s]` indicating a number of seconds
# - **Start and End Times** of each sentence are provided at the end of each sentence
# - **B-roll segments** are marked with #  for each sentence`# text #`

# # Zoom-in Key Indicators (Ranked by Descending Priority)
# 1. **Keywords/Phrases**: Look for capitalized words or phrases that signify major importance, especially if they are **followed by a silence** or pause
# 2. **Important Concepts**: Phrases beginning with conjunctions such as "but...", "and...", "so...", or "if..."
# 3. **Emotional Questions**: Questions that convey strong emotion or enthusiasm
# 4. **Exclamations**: Statements like "This is incredible!" that carry exclamation

#                 - **B-roll segments** are marked with squared brackets `[ ]`. These segments indicate portions of the video overlaid with visuals and must **not** include zoom-ins.  

#                 # Zoom-in Key Indicators (Ranked by Descending Priority)  
#                 1. **Keywords/Phrases**: Look for capitalized words or phrases that signify major importance, especially if they are **followed by a silence** or pause.  
#                 2. **Important Concepts**: Phrases beginning with conjunctions such as “but...“, “and...“, “so...“, or “if...“.  
#                 3. **Emotional Questions**: Questions that convey strong emotion or enthusiasm.  
#                 4. **Exclamations**: Statements like “This is incredible!” that carry exclamation.  
#                 5. **General Emphasized Words**: Capitalized words or phrases not followed by a silence.  

#                 # Rules for Zoom-ins and Jump Cuts  
#                 - **Zoom-ins** should be followed by a jump cut, placed **at the end of a sentence or idea**. However, ensure at least a **3-second interval** between the zoom-in completion and the jump cut.  
#                 - Avoid overlapping zoom-ins; select the **most impactful moment** if key indicators are detected closely together.  
#                 - Ensure the chosen jump cuts do not interfere with subsequent zoom-ins and adequate spacing.  
#                 - Do not place zoom-ins or jump cuts during **b-roll segments**. The entire zoom process (zoom-in and jump cut) must occur **outside of b-roll segments** to avoid visual inconsistency.  

#                 # CRITICAL TIMING RULE  
#                 - Aim for **EXACTLY ONE zoom-in moment per minute** of video duration.  
#                 - For example:  
#                 - 5-minute video = EXACTLY 5 zoom-in moments  
#                 - 10-minute video = EXACTLY 10 zoom-in moments  
#                 - If it is **impossible** to meet the one-per-minute rule due to b-rolls or other constraints, ensure zoom-ins are spaced as evenly as possible throughout the video.  
#                 - ENSURE at least a **3-second interval** between the zoom-in completion and the jump cut.  
#                 - If no suitable zoom-in can be selected for a particular minute due to b-rolls or context, that minute can be skipped.  

#                 # Steps  

#                 1. **Identify Key Areas for Zoom-in**:  
#                 - Analyze the transcript and find potential zoom-in points based on the priority indicators.  
#                 - Exclude b-roll segments when identifying zoom-in points.  
#                 - Determine the emphasis and contextual importance of key moments before deciding zoom-in placement.  

#                 2. **Select the Optimal Zoom-in Point**:  
#                 - If multiple zoom-in points occur close together, prioritize the **most significant moment** using the ranking above.  
#                 - Avoid using too many zoom-ins in succession to avoid disorienting the viewer.  
#                 - Ensure zoom-ins are equally distributed across the video to maintain a balanced pacing. Avoid clustering zoom-ins in one section while leaving others sparse.  

#                 3. **Identify Transition Points**:  
#                 - Determine a suitable jump cut for each zoom-in — cue it at the **end of the sentence or idea**.  
#                 - If the zoom-in is in the end of the sentence, don’t select the next sentence start as a jump cut. Instead, find a more appropriate moment (e.g., the start of a sentence two sentences away or when the idea ends) to ensure the **3-second timing**.  
#                 - Ensure transitions align naturally to avoid interrupting important content flow.  
#                 - Ensure the entire zoom process (zoom-in and jump cut) avoids b-roll segments entirely.  

#                 4. **Verify Final Selections**:  
#                 - Check that zoom-ins do not overlap and balance emotional intensity or conceptual focus.  
#                 - Verify all transitions are smooth and do not interfere with the following zoom-in or overall narrative.  

#                 # Output Format  

#                 Return a JSON object with these fields: {“zoom_moments”: [{fields}]}  
#                 - **sentence_number**: The sentence number which is in the start of the sentence where the zoom-in occurs.  
#                 - **zoom_in_phrase**: The specific word/phrase exactly as written in the transcript where the zoom-in starts.  
#                 - **reason**: Why this keyword/phrase was chosen (explain based on provided priorities).  
#                 - **transition_sentence_number**: The sentence number where the jump cut transition occurs.  
#                 - **transition_sentence_word**: The exact word/phrase exactly as written in the transcript where the jump cut begins.  
#                 - **transition_reason**: Explanation for why this word marks the best transition point.  

#                 # Examples  

#                 ### Example 1  
#                 - **Sentence Number**: 28  
#                 - **Zoom-in Phrase**: “but this CHANGES EVERYTHING”  
#                 - **Reason**: Important concept signified by conjunction “but” followed by an emphasized phrase.  
#                 - **Transition Sentence Number**: 29  
#                 - **Transition Sentence Word**: “Let’s”  
#                 - **Transition Reason**: Start of the next sentence, marks a shift in direction, providing time for the idea to sink in before moving forward.  

#                 ### Example 2  
#                 - **Sentence Number**: 15  
#                 - **Zoom-in Phrase**: “SUCCESS”  
#                 - **Reason**: High emphasis word in capital letters followed by a 2-second pause indicating significance.  
#                 - **Transition Sentence Number**: 17  
#                 - **Transition Sentence Word**: “concluded”  
#                 - **Transition Reason**: Marks the end of the idea in sentence 15, ensures a natural flow to the next sentence.
